# Jupyter_Anime_Recommender
Round 1 (Anime_Ult.sql) & 3 of my anime recommender series. Round 2 is [here](https://github.com/trietvuive/Anime_Recommender) </br>
Last time I did Octave and it turned out to be too slow, so I'm doing Pandas this time around. </br>
The dataset is pulled from CooperUnion/Anime Recommendations Database and is ignored by git. Feel free to use your own dataset and steal the code. </br>
Also git ignores my own rating as well, because my anime preference is simply too good to share.
